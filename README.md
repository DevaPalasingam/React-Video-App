# React-Video-App

## Description
This is a log of me writing a Video App in React and what components I'm adding.

![Search Bar](screenshots/search.png "This is the screen where you can search all the different shows")
![Search Bar Example: Black](screenshots/search_black.png "The screen updates as you type")
![Details Example: Breaking Bad](screenshots/breakingBad.png "This is an example of when you look up the details of a specific show")

# How to Use
You can reach the landing page with this link:
https://devapalasingam.github.io/React-Video-App/#/

The search bar on the landing page isn't functional at the moment. If you click "or Browse All" you'll get a list of all the TV shows in the data.json. If you type something in the search bar, the screen will real-time-update with the shows that match what you type.

You can see specific details on each show with this link:
https://devapalasingam.github.io/React-Video-App/#/details/tt0903747
Just replace the last part with the imdbID found in the data.json.
